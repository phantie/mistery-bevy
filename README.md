It was educational, sorta fun. But I the effort you have to put
to make all work as you intend not worth the inverstment.

The framework is too <i><b>raw</b></i>, at least for serious game development.
Main issues:

  - no good way to scale game for different view ports
(what I could find already does not work in this
engine version, what I can think of seems awkward
if accomplishable at all)
  - no UI for level design
  - no UI for UI design
  - the issue #1 is dealbreaking

I had greater hopes, but failing fast is a good thing nonetheless.

I hope to try it again when it's a little more mature. Generic programming, systems, resources - all being just code is cool.
